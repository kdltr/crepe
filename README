To run this game you need to install the SDL2 library as well as
Cairo if you wish to run previous versions of it.

You will also need a recent version of CHICKEN 4.

You will also need the Scheme dependencies, which can be automatically
installed by running the install-dependencies.sh script. You will need
the git and sudo programs for that.
